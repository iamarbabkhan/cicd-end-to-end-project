I successfully built and deployed my Java application by following these steps:
1. Set up Jenkins and the necessary plugins like Git, Maven, Pipeline, and Kubernetes Continuous Deploy.

2. Created a new Jenkins pipeline and configured it with my Java application's Git repository URL.

3. Defined pipeline stages including checking out the source code, building the application with Maven, running unit tests, analyzing code quality with SonarQube, packaging the application, deploying to a test environment with Helm, running user acceptance tests, and promoting to production using Argo CD.

4. Configured each stage to integrate with the corresponding tools and plugins.
Installed Argo CD on my Kubernetes cluster, set up a Git repository for it, and created a Helm chart for my application.

5. Added the Helm chart to the Git repository tracked by Argo CD and configured Jenkins to integrate with Argo CD by adding the API token.

6. Ran the Jenkins pipeline to trigger the CI/CD process, monitored the stages, and addressed any issues that arose.

With these steps, I automated the entire process of building and deploying my Java application using popular tools like SonarQube, Argo CD, Helm, and Kubernetes." #devopscommunity #devopsjob
